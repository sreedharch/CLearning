typedef you can use to give a type a new name.
typedef unsigned char BYTE;
BYTE  b1, b2;

typedef vs #define :
main.c
#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences âˆ’
    typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
    typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
